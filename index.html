                <br>
                <p> Hello everyone, my name is John Matthew Abion. I turned 19 last August 6 2022, and I'm currently studying<br>
                in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology.I'm a good listener,<br>
                a nice, calm, and quiet guy who you can trust. I'm a reliable person who enjoys setting goals for myself that<br>
                I can achieve in areas like schoolwork and household chores. I also enjoy watching movies, especially those <br>
                in the horror/thriller/psychological,action and sci-fi genres. I also enjoy listening to music of many genres,<br>
                but I tend to prefer kpop, pop, opm, and rnb most of the time. As a student, I'm pursuing this Bachelor of Science <br>
                in Information Technology course since I've learned about it since high school and because <br>
                I'm impressed by how much fun it is to learn code to create your own website and game,also both of my parents<br>
                are have knowledge about it too.</p>

            This is my family. We have four family members, with me being the youngest.<br>
            My father's name is Glojess Abion, and he is 47 years old. He works as a<br>
            technical staff at Need Ink Company, and my mother's name is Marites Abion,<br>
            she is also 47 years old and works at home as a customer service representative,<br>
            and my brother is Linus Joaquin Marco Abion,21 years old and currently enrolled<br>
            at the Asian Institute of Maritime Studies in his second year of college.<br>
            This photo was taken on New Year's Eve, when we celebrated the New Year<br>
            with our other relatives. We had a great time, and we hope that 2023<br>
            will be a wonderful year for us and for you as well.</span>

                <h1 class="headings">Strength</h1>
                <p>My strengths in this field is that I have an idea 
                about it,such as simple programming languages, <br>
                creating websites,and knowledge of c++ and <br>
                visual basic. I am also reliable and creative<br>
                in making designs if I have enough time to do so. </p>

            <div class="box">
                <h1 class="headings">Weakness </h1>
                <p>My weaknesses in the IT field are memorizing <br>
                variables in different programming languages <br>
                since I forget them so quickly.I also struggle to <br>
                concentrate on my homework or tasks since I lack<br>
                time management skills and I am easily distracted<br>
                Some of my weaknesses are public speaking, shyness,and a lack of creativity.</p>

             <div class="box">
                <h1 class="headings">Future Job</h1>
                <p>After graduation, all I want is a decent and steady <br>
                job that will allow me to meet my needs and support my loved ones. In terms of IT, <br>
                I see myself as a web developer or any other IT specialist because I am knowledgeable about it <br>
                and it is in high demand right now.</p>
